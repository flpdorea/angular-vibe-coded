# Gemininho: Vibe Coding with Gemini

This project, "Gemininho," is an experimental Angular frontend application developed primarily through a process of "vibe coding" with the Gemini AI. The intent is to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of AI-assisted development, leveraging Gemini's understanding of code, context files, and interaction with simulated "MCP servers" (Managed Code Production servers, representing a controlled environment for code generation and modification).

It serves as a living example of how an AI agent can interpret natural language requests, understand project conventions, and implement features in a modern Angular environment, utilizing tools and adhering to best practices.

## Running the Application

To get the application up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed. Then, install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start Development Server:** Launch the development server:

    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```

    Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload as you make changes to the source files.

## Running Tests

To execute the unit tests for this project, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

This will run the tests using the Karma test runner.
